# NeuralTensorNetwork-Tensorflow

This is a reimplementation of "Reasoning With Neural Tensor Networks for Knowledge Base Completion" by Socher et al.

While going through the reimplementation in depth, I found that the original Matlab code by the authors contained a backpropogation bug. 
My blog post in this regard is present at: https://medium.com/@zaidhassanchaudhry/reasoning-with-neural-tensor-networks-for-knowledge-base-completion-re-implementation-a07d9ea0c89e
